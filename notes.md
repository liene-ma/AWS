### 6 ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
2. Massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed & agility
5. Stop spending money running & maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

### CLOUD COMPUTING MODELS

**IaaS** - Infrastructure as a Service \
networking features, computers, data storage

**PaaS** - Platform as a Service \
no need to focus on infrastructure, allows to focus on deployment+management; no worries about resource procurrement, capacity planning, maintenance

**SaaS** - Software as a Service \
complete product, end-user applications (ex. web based email)

**25 AWS regions (physical locations)** - designed to be completely isolated from others --> fault tolerance, stability.  \
**80 Availability Zones (data centers)** - AZ in regions are connected through low latency links.

### CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT MODELS

**CLOUD** \
fully deployed in the cloud, everything rins in the cloud; apps created or migrated to the cloud

**HYBRID** \
it's a way to connect infrastructure and apps between cloud & existing resources; used to extend and grow infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud to internal system.

**ON-PREMISES** \
private cloud (virtualization, resource mgmt tools); ability to provide dedicated resources. 

**AWS provides global infrastructure >1m users, 240 countries. Low latency, high output.**
